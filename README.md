Terminal Tetromino Clock in Rust - When Tetris Meets Time!

# âŒšTetro Time ðŸŽ®

## Overview

A tetris/tetromino based clock, timer and stopwatch for your **terminal**, which
displays the time using falling tetrominos. The rendering is done using the
[PixelLoop](https://crates.io/crates/pixel_loop) engine. If you are interested
in the development of this and other projects check out my YouTube channel
[MrJakob](https://youtube.com/c/mrjakob), where I live code this and other
projects.
